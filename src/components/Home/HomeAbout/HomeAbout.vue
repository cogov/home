        <h3 class="homeAbout__subtitle">CoGov enables rapid structure iteration so people 
            can easily test multiple methods of decision making, structuring agreements,
            conflict resolution, and value exchange.

                <p class="homeAbout__item--description">
                    New forms of community and business are arising. but unless they can 
                    create economies of scale, they canâ€™t compete with the old systems and 
                    attract people out of the old systems. CoGov enables that scalability 
                    out of the box.

                    We enable people to not just participate in 
                    systems, but participate in the DESIGN of those systems, 
                    and redesign them and tweak the design of those systems over and over 
                    until they get it right.

                <p class="homeAbout__item--description">
                    A whole new era of software interoperability is coming forth 
                    thanks to Holochain. There is no longer a need for clunky and 
                    burdensome APIs to allow applications to connect with each other. 
                    CoGov ensures that the same level of interoperability exists between 
                    Collectives and their Currencies.
