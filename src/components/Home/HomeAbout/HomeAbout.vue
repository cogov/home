                        The Earth’s air is an unenclosable carrier. It cannot be owned or 
                        controlled. With air, we can communicate with others because we 
                        can speak and be heard by others. Unenclosable communication is 
                        critical to cohesive group interactions because it means that

                        experience of humanness. Holochain is the world's first and only digital,

                        New forms of community and business are arising. 
                        but unless they can create economies of scale, 
                        they can’t compete with the old systems and attract people out 
                        of the old systems. CoGov enables that scalability out of the box.
