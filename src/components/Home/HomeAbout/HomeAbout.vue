            <h2 class="homeAbout__title">What is CoGov?</h2>
            <h3 class="homeAbout__body">
                <span class="homeAbout__subtitle">CoGov</span> is a proposal for a <a href="/ecosystem">ecosystem of startups</a>, with each startup modeling its operations to be infused with <a href="https://medium.com/@rayzer42/cogov-presents-a-digital-protocol-for-scaling-loving-kindness-1da6605f88d9" target="_blank">Loving Kindness</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@rayzer42/cogov-presents-a-digital-protocol-for-scaling-loving-kindness-1da6605f88d9" target="_blank">Vulnerable Transparency</a>, which is also omini-win and anti-rivalrous.
                    Keys to accomplishing this goal include the implementation of a common, shared cryptocurrency and <a href="/protocol.love">protocol.love</a>.<br />
                    <br />
                    The success of this endeavor relies on the ability to
                    create similar efficiencies of scale that exist in the current global socioeconomic paradigm (Game A).
                    In order to accomplish this goal at a such a scale, interoperability is critical. 
                    <a href="/protocol.love">Protocol.love</a> enables this interoperatbility 
                    for all those who choose a commitment to <a href="https://medium.com/@rayzer42/cogov-presents-a-digital-protocol-for-scaling-loving-kindness-1da6605f88d9" target="_blank">Vulnerable Transparency</a>.  
                    
                    As each of our partner projects (many of which are also startup ecosystems) reach maturity, we will create a magnetic attraction field
                    within which evolutionary transformation can ultimately lead to the transformation of the global socioeconomic paradigm.

                We don’t just need new social systems. We need a framework within 
                which we can experiment with  
                new social systems real-time, in a way that moves humanity forward quickly, while 
                avoiding existential threats. A New Earth is emerging, where citizens
                are no longer merely participants in social systems, but they are fully
                engaged in the creation and rapid iteration of those systems.

                CoGov is a semi-autonomous socioeconomic ecosystem, powered by <a href="/protocol.love">protocol.love</a>, 
                that enhances the ability of sovereign 
                individuals to come together to make sense, and make 
                decisions with the greatest holopticism (ability to see the whole). 
                By sharing operations, and curating resources with <a href="https://medium.com/@rayzer42/cogov-presents-a-digital-protocol-for-scaling-loving-kindness-1da6605f88d9" target="_blank">Vulnerable Transparency</a>,
                communities can work with even amateur developers to create 
                new ways of sharing resources, contracts, data, money and cryptocurrencies, 
                payments and transactions, IP, and other assets— all with complete assurance 
                that whatever kind of asset governance they invent, creators are recognized, 
                and scalability can be acheived through interoperability with other organizations

                        The Earth’s air is an unenclosable carrier for sound waves— a carrier that cannot be owned or 
                        controlled. With air, we can communicate with others because we 
                        can speak and be heard by others. Unenclosable communication is 
                        critical to cohesive group interactions because it means that 
                        humans have the ability to interact directly with each other—to 
                        feel and see and know each other and to empathize from our shared
